# Delta Online

We have deployed a 3-node Delta network for demonstration on the Delta homepage:

Since the capacity of the system is limited, and now we don't yet have a robust isolated execution environment for Delta Task, the account registration of the online system is restricted and requires manual approval from system administrators. Please join Delta's Slack channel and ask for approval after registration.

We have put some common open datasets on the Delta Nodes, the datasets are split on both samples and features and put on different nodes to simulate the split of data in privacy-preserving computation. Please find the details on the docs in JupyterLab after login to Deltaboard.
